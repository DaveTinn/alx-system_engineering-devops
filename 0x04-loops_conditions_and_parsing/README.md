# *LOOPS, CONDITIONS AND PARSING

## Description: Exploring the concepts of loops, conditions and parsing in programming. Understanding these concepts is essential for writing logical and efficient codes'

### Concepts
->> **Loops:**: are used to repeat a specific block of codes until a certain condition is met.
Common loops are 'for', 'while', and 'do-while'.

->> **Conditions:** allows the program to make decisions based on certain  conditions. Examples are 'if', 'else if', and 'else'.

->> **Parsing:** involves analyzing a sequence of symbols or text to extract meaningful information.
