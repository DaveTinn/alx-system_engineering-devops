#			API (APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACE)
API is a set of routines, protocols and rules for building software applications. It defines how software components should interact. It is a part of a remote server that receives requests and sends responses.

We also have REST (Representational State Transfer) API.  It is a way for two computer systems to communicate using HTTP technologies found in web browsers and servers.

In summary;
API provides the interface for systems to communicate with each other.
REST is a widely adopted style of API that we use to interact with internal and external parties in a consistent and predictable way.
